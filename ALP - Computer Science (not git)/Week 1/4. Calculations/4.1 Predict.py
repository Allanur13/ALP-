# Add comments to this code to predict what it will do.
print(8 + 2)
#it will display 10. Adds 8 with 2

print( 8 - 2)
#it will display 6. Subtracts 8 by 2

print(8 * 2)
#it will display 16. Multiplies 8 by 2

print(10 / 4)
#it will display 2.5. It divides 10 by 4 and it's also a real number

print(10 // 4)
#it will display 2. It will only display integer, not the real number, so the output is only the numbers before the dot. It is also known as floor division

# This code uses variables in place of numbers in the calculation.  Add comments to explain how it works.

num1 = 20
#assigns variable num1 to an integer 20
num2 = 5
#assigns variable num2 to an integer 5
result = num1 * num2
#the variable result will multiply and assign two variables num1 and num2 in the form of integers
print(result)
#displays the result (20*5=100), which is an integer 100
# This code uses input to assign data into a variable.  Add comments to explain how it works.
print("Enter a number")
num1 = int(input())
#it gets an input and converts it to an integer and assigns to num1
num2 = 2
#assigns num2 to an integer 2
result = num1 // num2
#divides num1 by num2 and rounds the result down to the nearest integer and assigns it to result variable
print(result)
#prints result
