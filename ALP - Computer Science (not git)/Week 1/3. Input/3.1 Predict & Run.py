#Task 1 - Add comments to the code below to predict what will happen when it is run.

#Task 2 - add comments to the code to explain what the variable(s) are called and where they are used. Make sure to show where the variable.

print("Hi! What's your name?")
# Hi! What's your name?
# Here the function print will display the parameter "Hi! What's your name?"
name = input()
# A variable called name will take on input from a user
# here the variable name is whatever the user input in the console

print("Hi " + name + "! How are you today?")
# It will concatenate "Hi " string with a variable name and "! How are you today?" 
# A variable is used here
